# fibonacci
it can calculate the fib of any number, using a recursive function. but unlike most python programs that do this i found a way aroud the 499 max recursion limit, using a for loop and casheing. its fast as fuck, and compleatly cheeses the computer science class :)
arguable one of my greatest achivements, when i apply for a job at mcdonalds im gonna present my github when they ask me for my achivments no joke i will do it
